          <span>Real estate law "Hawkins v. McGee" (1929)</span>
          
          <p>One of the most famous cases in real estate law in the United States is "Hawkins v. McGee" (1929), often referred to as the "Hairy Hand" case. While not exclusively a real estate case, it involves a contract for a surgical procedure that led to a legal dispute with implications for the law of damages and the concept of specific performance in real estate contracts.<br> <span>Case Background</span> <br>
            In "Hawkins v. McGee," a young man named George Hawkins suffered a hand injury that left his hand scarred and partially deformed. He sought medical treatment from Dr. E.C. McGee, who promised to make his hand "100% perfect." Dr. McGee performed a skin grafting procedure on Hawkins' hand with the intention of removing the scar and deformity.
            
            <br><span>Real Estate Law Connection</span><br>
            
            The real estate law connection comes into play when considering the legal remedy sought by Hawkins. After the surgery did not result in a "100% perfect" hand and instead left it worse than before, Hawkins sued Dr. McGee for breach of contract. In his claim, Hawkins sought damages in the amount of the difference between what was promised (a perfect hand) and what was delivered (a scarred and deformed hand).
            
            <br><span>Litigation and Outcome </span><br>
            
            The case went to court, and the key legal question was whether damages could be awarded based on the difference between the promised outcome and the actual result. The court ruled in favor of Hawkins and awarded him damages, which became known as "expectation damages." In essence, this meant that the damages were calculated based on what Hawkins expected to receive under the contract. <br> <span>Impact</span>
            <br>While "Hawkins v. McGee" is not a real estate case per se, it is often cited in contract law and, by extension, in real estate law to illustrate the concept of expectation damages. In real estate transactions, this concept can come into play when a party believes they did not receive what was promised in a contract, such as a purchase and sale agreement or a lease. The case has been influential in shaping contract law principles related to damages and the measure of relief for contract breaches.

            Moreover, "Hawkins v. McGee" is frequently used in legal education to teach contract law and the principles of damages, making it a well-known case in the broader legal community.</p>
